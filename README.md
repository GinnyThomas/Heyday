# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
# Anonymeet

This application is an anonymous preference survey app to arrange a meet-up with friends.  It is a web based application.

## App Requirements
You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console. (You don't need to
implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
Deposits, withdrawal.
Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

## Usage
Open terminal
```
$ node

npm start
npm install sass

```
Include the example code in Usage as a file in your repo -- maybe as example.js. It's great to have README code that users can actually run if they clone the repository.
This project uses node and npm. Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.
$ npm install --global standard-readme-spec


### Installation
To use the codebase on your computer, Use
```bash
$ npm install react-router-dom@6

```


## Usage
Open terminal
```
$ node


```

Name -- self-explanatory names are best. collide-2d-aabb-aabb sounds promising, though it assumes I know what an "aabb" is. If the name sounds too vague or unrelated, it may be a signal to move on.
One-liner -- having a one-liner that describes the module is useful for getting an idea of what the module does in slightly greater detail. collide-2d-aabb-aabb says it
Determines whether a moving axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) collides with other AABBs.
Awesome: it defines what an AABB is, and what the module does. Now to gauge how well it'd fit into my code:
Usage -- rather than starting to delve into the API docs, it'd be great to see what the module looks like in action. I can quickly determine whether the example JS fits the desired style and problem. People have lots of opinions on things like promises/callbacks and ES6. If it does fit the bill, then I can proceed to greater detail.
API -- the name, description, and usage of this module all sound appealing to me. I'm very likely to use this module at this point. I just need to scan the API to make sure it does exactly what I need and that it will integrate easily into my codebase. The API section ought to detail the module's objects and functions, their signatures, return types, callbacks, and events in detail. Types should be included where they aren't obvious. Caveats should be made clear.
Installation -- if I've read this far down, then I'm sold on trying out the module. If there are nonstandard installation notes, here's where they'd go, but even if it's just a regular npm install, I'd like to see that mentioned, too. New users start using Node all the time, so having a link to npmjs.org and an install command provides them the resources to figure out how Node modules work.
License -- most modules put this at the very bottom, but this might actually be better to have higher up; you're likely to exclude a module VERY quickly if it has a license incompatible with your work. I generally stick to the MIT/BSD/X11/ISC flavours. If you have a non-permissive license, stick it at the very top of the module to prevent any confusion.
