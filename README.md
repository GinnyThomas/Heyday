 # Heyday

----
### Description
This application is an anonymous preference survey app to arrange a meet-up with friends.  It is a web based 
application. 

The idea of Heyday, prior to being named, came from [Matt Zimmer](https://github.com/Zimmja). Although
getting together with friends is fun, the process of finding the day that works best for everyone can be a headache, 
especially when you often find yourself committing to a day you would rather not because that is when so-and-so if free.

Heyday puts anonymous into your next meeting by using algorithms to calculate the best 
date to meet based on the submitted answers of your friends.  

- this portion may be removed if we do not meet stretch goals

Although the idea started with picking the best date, Heyday goes beyond that and can help 
add anonymity to other stuff like picking a restaurant or an event location. Add your desired criteria and give it a

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

We also used
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

We selected these technologies to gain additional JavaScript and React knowledge prior to finishing the Maker's 
Bootcamp. Sass was used to enhance features of CSS styling.
